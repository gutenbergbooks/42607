 <p class="hello"><span class="m">TO THE MOST EXCELLENT AND LEARNED</span> <br /><span class="gesperrt">BOTH ORATOR AND POET,
	</span><br /><span class="gesperrt">MAISTER GABRIEL HARVEY,</span></p>
    <p class="london">His very special and singular good friend E. K.<br />commendeth the good liking of this his good<br />
	labour, and the patronage of the new Poet.</p>
    <p class="p2">Uncouth, unkiss'd, said the old famous poet Chaucer: whom for his
excellency and wonderful skill in making, his scholar Lidgate, a worthy
scholar of so excellent a maister, calleth the loadstar of our language:
and whom our Colin Clout in his Æglogue, calleth Tityrus the god of
shepheards, comparing him to the worthiness of the Roman Tityrus,
Virgil. Which proverb, mine own good friend M. Harvey, as in that good
old poet it served well Pandar's purpose for the bolstering of his bawdy
brocage, so very well taketh place in this our new Poet, who for that he
is uncouth (as said Chaucer) is unkiss'd, and unknown to most men, is
regarded but of a few. But I doubt not, so soon as his name shall come
into the knowledge of men, and his worthiness be sounded in the trump of
Fame, but that he shall be not only kiss'd, but also beloved of all,
embraced of the most, and wonder'd at of the best. No less, I think,
deserveth his wittiness in devising, his pithiness in uttering, his
complaints of love so lovely, his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly,
his pastoral rudeness, his moral wiseness, his due observing of decorum
every where, in personages, in seasons, in matter, in speech; and
generally, in all seemly simplicity of handling his matters, and framing
his words: the which of many things which in him be strange, I know will
seem the strangest, and words themselves being so ancient, the knitting
of them so short and intricate, and the whole period and compass of
speech so delightsome for the roundness, and so grave for the
strangeness. And first of the words to speak, I grant they be something
hard, and of most men unused, yet both English, and also used of most
excellent authors, and most famous poets. In whom, when as this our Poet
hath been much travailed and throughly read, how could it be, (as that
worthy orator said) but that walking in the sun, although for other
cause he walked, yet needs he must be sunburnt; and, having the sound of
those ancient poets still ringing in his ears, he must needs, in
singing, hit out some of their tunes. But whether he useth them by such
casualty and custom, or of set purpose and choice, as thinking them
fittest for such rustical rudeness of shepheards, either for that their
rough sound would make his rhymes more ragged and rustical; or else
because such old and obsolete words are most used of country folk, sure
I think, and think I think not amiss, that they bring great grace, and,
as one would say, authority to the verse. For albe, amongst many other
faults, it specially be objected of Valla against Livy, and of other
against Sallust, that with over much study they affect antiquity, as
covering thereby credence and honour of elder years; yet I am of
opinion, and eke the best learned are of the like, that those ancient
solemn words are a great ornament, both in the one, and in the other:
the one labouring to set forth in his work an eternal image of
antiquity, and the other carefully discoursing matters of gravity and
importance. For, if my memory fail not, Tully in that book, wherein he
endeavoureth to set forth the pattern of a perfect orator, saith that
ofttimes an ancient word maketh the style seem grave, and as it were
reverend, no otherwise than we honour and reverence gray hairs for a
certain religious regard, which we have of old age. Yet neither every
where must old words be stuffed in, nor the common dialect and manner of
speaking so corrupted thereby, that, as in old buildings, it seem
disorderly and ruinous. But all as in most exquisite pictures they us?e
to blaze and pourtray not only the dainty lineaments of beauty, but also
round about it to shadow the rude thickets and craggy clifts, that, by
the baseness of such parts, more excellency may accrue to the
principal: for oftentimes we find ourselves, I know not how, singularly
delighted with the shew of such natural rudeness, and take great
pleasure in that disorderly order. Even so do those rough and harsh
terms enlumine, and make more clearly to appear, the brightness of brave
and glorious words. So oftentimes a discord in music maketh a comely
concordance: so great delight took the worthy poet Alceus to behold a
blemish in the joint of a well-shaped body. But, if any will rashly
blame such his purpose in choice of old and unwonted words, him may I
more justly blame and condemn, or of witless headiness in judging, or of
heedless hardiness in condemning: for, not marking the compass of his
bent, he will judge of the length of his cast: for in my opinion it is
one especial praise of many, which are due to this Poet, that he hath
laboured to restore, as to their rightful heritage, such good and
natural English words, as have been long time out of use, and almost
clean disherited. Which is the only cause, that our mother tongue, which
truly of itself is both full enough for prose, and stately enough for
verse, hath long time been counted most bare and barren of both. Which
default when as some endeavoured to salve and recure, they patched up
the holes with pieces and rags of other languages, borrowing here of
the French, there of the Italian, every where of the Latin; not
weighing how ill those tongues accord with themselves, but much worse
with ours: So now they have made our English tongue a gallimaufrey, or
hodgepodge of all other speeches. Other some not so well seen in the
English tongue, as perhaps in other languages, if they happen to hear an
old word, albeit very natural and significant, cry out straightway, that
we speak no English, but gibberish, or rather such as in old time
Evander's mother spake: whose first shame is, that they are not ashamed,
in their own mother tongue, to be counted strangers and aliens. The
second shame no less than the first, that what so they understand not,
they straightway deem to be senseless, and not at all to be understood.
Much like to the mole in Æsop's fable, that, being blind herself, would
in no wise be persuaded that any beast could see. The last, more
shameful than both, that of their own country and natural speech, which
together with their nurse's milk they sucked, they have so base regard
and bastard judgment, that they will not only themselves not labour to
garnish and beautify it, but also repine, that of other it should be
embellished. Like to the dog in the manger, that himself can eat no hay,
and yet barketh at the hungry bullock, that so fain would feed: whose
currish kind, though it cannot be kept from barking, yet I conne them
thank that they refrain from biting.</p>
    <p>Now, for the knitting of sentences, which they call the joints and
members thereof, and for all the compass of the speech, it is round
without roughness, and learned without hardness, such indeed as may be
perceived of the least, understood of the most, but judged only of the
learned. For what in most English writers useth to be loose, and as it
were unright, in this Author is well grounded, finely framed, and
strongly trussed up together. In regard whereof, I scorn and spue out
the rakehelly rout of our ragged rhymers (for so themselves use to hunt
the letter) which without learning boast, without judgment jangle,
without reason rage and foam, as if some instinct of poetical spirit had
newly ravished them above the meanness of common capacity. And being, in
the midst of all their bravery, suddenly, either for want of matter, or
rhyme; or having forgotten their former conceit; they seem to be so
pained and travailed in their remembrance, as it were a woman in
childbirth, or as that same Pythia, when the trance came upon her. "<i>Os
rabidum fera corda domans</i>," etc.</p>
    <p>Nathless, let them a God's name feed on their own folly, so they seek
not to darken the beams of others' glory. As for Colin, under whose
person the Author's self is shadowed, how far he is from such vaunted
titles and glorious shews, both himself sheweth, where he saith:</p>
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse2">"Of Muses, Hobbin, I conne no skill."</div>
</div>
<p>And,</p>
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse2">"Enough is me to paint out my unrest," etc.</div>
</div>
<p>And also appeareth by the baseness of the name, wherein it seemeth he
chose rather to unfold great matter of argument covertly than,
professing it, not suffice thereto accordingly. Which moved him rather
in Æglogues than otherwise to write, doubting perhaps his ability, which
he little needed, or minding to furnish our tongue with this kind,
wherein it faulteth; or following the example of the best and most
ancient poets, which devised this kind of writing, being both so base
for the matter, and homely for the manner, at the first to try their
abilities; and as young birds, that be newly crept out of the nest, by
little first prove their tender wings, before they make a greater
flight. So flew Theocritus, as you may perceive he was already full
fledged. So flew Virgil, as not yet well feeling his wings. So flew
Mantuane, as not being full somm'd. So Petrarch. So Boccace. So Marot,
Sanazarius, and also divers other excellent both Italian and French
poets, whose footing this author every where followeth: yet so as few,
but they be well scented, can trace him out. So finally flieth this our
new Poet as a bird whose principals be scarce grown out, but yet as one
that in time shall be able to keep wing with the best. Now, as touching
the general drift and purpose of his Æglogues, I mind not to say much,
himself labouring to conceal it. Only this appeareth, that his unstayed
youth had long wander'd in the common labyrinth of love, in which time
to mitigate and allay the heat of his passion, or else to warn (as he
saith) the young shepheards, his equals and companions, of his
unfortunate folly, he compiled these twelve Æglogues, which, for that
they be proportioned to the state of the twelve monethes, he termeth it
the <i>Shepheard's Calender</i>, applying an old name to a new work. Hereunto
have I added a certain gloss, or scholion, for the exposition of old
words and harder phrases; which manner of glossing and commenting, well
I wot, will seem strange and rare in our tongue: yet, for so much as I
knew many excellent and proper devices, both in words and matter, would
pass in the speedy course of reading either as unknown, or as not
marked; and that in this kind, as in other, we might be equal to the
learned of other nations; I thought good to take the pains upon me, the
rather for that by means of some familiar acquaintance I was made privy
to his counsel and secret meaning in them, as also in sundry other
works of his. Which albeit I know he nothing so much hateth, as to
promulgate, yet thus much have I adventured upon his friendship, himself
being for long time far estranged; hoping that this will the rather
occasion him to put forth divers other excellent works of his, which
sleep in silence; as his <i>Dreams</i>, his <i>Legends</i>, his <i>Court of Cupid</i>,
and sundry others, whose commendation to set out were very vain, the
things though worthy of many, yet being known to few. These my present
pains, if to any they be pleasurable or profitable, be you judge, mine
own Maister Harvey, to whom I have both in respect of your worthiness
generally, and otherwise upon some particular and special
considerations, vowed this my labour, and the maidenhead of this our
common friend's poetry; himself having already in the beginning
dedicated it to the noble and worthy gentleman, the right worshipful
Maister Philip Sidney, a special favourer and maintainer of all kind of
learning. Whose cause, I pray you, sir, if envy shall stir up any
wrongful accusation, defend with your mighty rhetoric and other your
rathe gifts of learning, as you can, and shield with your good will, as
you ought, against the malice and outrage of so many enemies, as I know
will be set on fire with the sparks of his kindled glory. And thus
recommending the Author unto you, as unto his most special good friend,
and myself unto you both, as one making singular account of two so very
good and so choice friends, I bid you both most heartily farewell, and
commit you and your commendable studies to the tuition of the Greatest.</p>
    <p class="center">Your own assuredly to be commanded,</p>
    <p class="right">E. K.<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fnanchor1" name="fnanchor1">&nbsp;</a><a href="#footnote1">1</a></span></p>
    <p class="p2">P.S.&mdash;Now I trust, M. Harvey, that upon sight of your special friend's and fellow poet's doings, or else for envy of so many
	unworthy Quidams, which catch at the garland which to you alone is due, you will be persuaded to pluck out of the hateful darkness those so
	many excellent English poems of yours which lie hid, and bring them forth to eternal light. Trust me, you do both them great wrong, in
	depriving them of the desired sun; and also yourself, in smothering your deserved praises; and all men generally, in withholding from them

    <p class="beg">THE GENERAL ARGUMENT OF THE WHOLE BOOK.</p>
      <p class="p2">Little, I hope, needeth me at large to discourse the first original
        of &AElig;glogues, having already touched the same. But, for the word
        &AElig;glogues I know is
        unknown to most, and also mistaken of some of the best learned, (as they
        think,) I will say somewhat thereof, being not at all impertinent to my
        present purpose.</p>
    <p>They were first of the Greeks, the inventors of them, called <i>Aeglogai, as it were Aegon, or Aeginomon logi</i>, that is, Goatherds' tales.
	For although in Virgil and others the speakers be more shepheards than goatherds, yet Theocritus, in whom is more ground of authority than in
	Virgil, this specially from that deriving, as from the first head and wellspring, the whole invention of these &AElig;glogues maketh goatherds
	the persons and authors of his tales. This being, who seeth not the grossness of such as by colour of learning would make us believe, that they
	are more rightly termed <i>Eclogai</i>, as they would say, extraordinary discourses of unnecessary matter: which definition albe in substance
	and meaning it agree with the nature of the thing, yet no whit answereth with the analysis and interpretation of the word. For they be not
	termed <i>Eclogues</i>, but <i>&AElig;glogues</i>; which sentence this Author very well observing, upon good judgment, though indeed few goatherds
	have to do herein, nevertheless doubteth not to call them by the used and best known name. Other curious discourses hereof I reserve to greater
	occasion.</p>
    <p>These twelve &AElig;glogues, every where answering to the seasons of the twelve monethes, may be well divided into three forms or ranks.
	For either they be plaintive, as the first, the sixth, the eleventh, and the twelfth; or recreative, such as all those be, which contain matter
	of love, or commendation of special personages; or moral, which for the most part be mixed with some satyrical bitterness; namely, the second,
	of reverence due to old age; the fifth, of coloured deceit; the seventh and ninth, of dissolute shepheards and pastors; the tenth, of contempt
	of Poetry and pleasant Wits. And to this division may every thing herein be reasonably applied; a few only except, whose special purpose and
	meaning I am not privy to. And thus much generally of these twelve &AElig;glogues. Now will we speak particularly of all, and first of the
	first, which he calleth by the first moneth's name, Januarie: wherein to some he may seem foully to have faulted, in that he erroneously
	beginneth with that moneth, which beginneth not the year. For it is well known, and stoutly maintained with strong reasons of the learned, that
	the year beginneth in March; for then the sun reneweth his finished course, and the seasonable spring refresheth the earth, and the pleasance
	thereof, being buried in the sadness of the dead winter now worn away, reliveth. </p>
    <p>This opinion maintain the old Astrologers and Philosophers, namely, the reverend Andalo, and Macrobius in his <i>Holy Days of Saturn</i>;
	which account also was generally observed both of Grecians and Romans. But, saving the leave of such learned heads, we maintain a custom of
	counting the seasons from the moneth Januarie, upon a more special cause than the heathen Philosophers ever could conceive, that is, for the
	Incarnation of our mighty Saviour, and Eternal Redeemer the Lord Christ, who as then renewing the state of the decayed world, and returning
	the compass of expired years to their former date and first commencement, left to us his heirs a memorial of his birth in the end of the last
	year and beginning of the next. Which reckoning, beside that eternal monument of our salvation, leaneth also upon good proof of special judgment. </p>
    <p>For albeit that in elder times, when as yet the count of the year was not perfected, as afterward it was by Julius C&aelig;sar, they began
	to tell the monethes from March's beginning, and according to the same, God (as is said in Scripture) commanded the people of the Jews, to
	count the moneth <i>Abib</i>, that which we call March, for the first moneth, in remembrance that in that moneth he brought them out of the
	land of Egypt: yet, according to tradition of latter times it hath been otherwise observed, both in government of the Church and rule of
	mightiest realms. For from Julius C&aelig;sar who first observed the leap year, which he called <i>Bissextilem Annum</i>, and brought into a
	more certain course the odd wand'ring days which of the Greeks were called <i>Hyperbainontes</i>, of the Romans <i>Intercalares</i>, (for in
	such matter of learning I am forced to use the terms of the learned,) the monethes have been numbered twelve, which in the first ordinance of
	Romulus were but ten, counting but 304 days in every year, and beginning with March. But Numa Pompilius, who was the father of all the Roman
	ceremonies and religion, seeing that reckoning to agree neither with the course of the sun nor the moon, thereunto added two monethes, Januarie
	and Februarie; wherein it seemeth, that wise king minded upon good reason to begin the year at Januarie, of him therefore so called <i>tanquam
	janua anni</i>, the gate and entrance of the year; or of the name of the god <i>Janus</i>, to which god for that the old Paynims attributed
	the birth and beginning of all creatures new coming into the world, it seemeth that he <i>therefore</i> to him assigned the beginning and first
	entrance of the year. Which account for the most part hath hitherto continued: notwithstanding that the Egyptians begin their year at September;
	for that, according to the opinion of the best Rabbins and very purpose of the Scripture itself, God made the world in that moneth, that is
	called of them <i>Tisri</i>. And therefore he commanded them to keep the feast of Pavilions in the end of the year, in the xv. day of the
	seventh moneth, which before that time was the first.</p>
    <p>But our author, respecting neither the subtilty of the one part, nor the antiquity of the other, thinketh it fittest, according to the
	simplicity of common understanding, to begin with Januarie; weening it perhaps no <i>decorum</i> that shepheards should be seen in matter of so
	deep insight, or canvass a case of so doubtful judgment. So therefore beginneth he, and so continueth he throughout. </p>

    <p class="p2">In this first &AElig;glogue Colin Clout, a shepheard's boy, complaineth himself of his unfortunate love, being but newly (as seemeth)
	enamoured of a country lass called Rosalind: with which strong affection being very sore travailed, he compareth his careful case to the sad
	season of the year, to the frosty ground, to the frozen trees, and to his own winter-beaten flock. And lastly, finding himself robbed of all
	former pleasance and delight, he breaketh his pipe in pieces, and casteth himself to the ground.</p>

	an unhappy herdman's boy. The matter very well accordeth with the season of the moneth, the year now drooping, and as it were drawing
	to his last age. For as in this time of year, so then in our bodies, there is a dry and withering cold, which congealeth the curdled
	blood, and freezeth the weather-beaten flesh, with storms of Fortune and hoar-frosts of Care. To which purpose the old man telleth a
	tale of the Oak and the Brier, so lively, and so feelingly, as, if the thing were set forth in some picture before our eyes, more plainly
	could not appear. </p>

        <div class="verse">For youth is a bubble blown up with breath,</div>
        <div class="verse">Whose wit is weakness, whose wage is death,</div>
        <div class="verse">Whose way is wilderness, whose inn penance,</div>
        <div class="verse">And stoop-gallant Age, the host of Grievance.</div>
        <div class="verse">But shall I tell thee a tale of truth,</div>
        <div class="verse">Which I cond of Tityrus in my youth,</div>
        <div class="verse">Keeping his sheep on the hills of Kent?</div>
        <div class="verse">CUD. To nought more, Thenot, my mind is bent</div>
        <div class="verse">Than to hear novels of his devise;</div>
        <div class="verse">They be so well thewed, and so wise,</div>
        <div class="verse">Whatever that good old man bespake.</div>
        <div class="verse">THE. Many meet tales of youth did he make,</div>
        <div class="verse">And some of love, and some of chivalry;</div>
        <div class="verse">But none fitter than this to apply.</div>
        <div class="verse">Now listen a while and hearken the end.</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;There grew an aged tree on the green,</div>
        <div class="verse">A goodly Oak sometime had it been,</div>
        <div class="verse">With arms full strong and largely display'd,</div>
        <div class="verse">But of their leaves they were disarray'd:</div>
        <div class="verse">The body big, and mightily pight,</div>
        <div class="verse">Throughly rooted, and of wondrous height;</div>
        <div class="verse">Whilome had been the king of the field,</div>
        <div class="verse">And mochell mast to the husband did yield,</div>
        <div class="verse">And with his nuts larded many swine:</div>
        <div class="verse">But now the gray moss marred his rine;</div>
        <div class="verse">His bared boughs were beaten with storms,</div>
        <div class="verse">His top was bald, and wasted with worms,</div>
        <div class="verse">His honour decayed, his branches sere.</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;Hard by his side grew a bragging Brere,</div>
        <div class="verse">Which proudly thrust into th' element,</div>
        <div class="verse">And seemed to threat the firmament:</div>
        <div class="verse">It was embellish'd with blossoms fair,</div>
        <div class="verse">And thereto aye wonted to repair</div>
        <div class="verse">The shepheards' daughters to gather flowers,</div>
        <div class="verse">To paint their garlands with his colours;</div>
        <div class="verse">And in his small bushes used to shroud</div>
        <div class="verse">The sweet nightingale singing so loud;</div>
        <div class="verse">Which made this foolish Brere wax so bold,</div>
        <div class="verse">That on a time he cast him to scold</div>
        <div class="verse">And snebbe the good Oak, for he was old.</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;'Why standst there (quoth he) thou brutish block?</div>
        <div class="verse">Nor for fruit nor for shadow serves thy stock;</div>
        <div class="verse">Seest how fresh my flowers be spread,</div>
        <div class="verse">Dyed in lily white and crimson red,</div>
        <div class="verse">With leaves engrained in lusty green;</div>
        <div class="verse">Colours meet to clothe a maiden queen?</div>
        <div class="verse">Thy waste bigness but cumbers the ground,</div>
        <div class="verse">And dirks the beauty of my blossoms round:</div>
        <div class="verse">The mouldy moss, which thee accloyeth,</div>
        <div class="verse">My cinnamon smell too much annoyeth:</div>
        <div class="verse">Wherefore soon I rede thee hence remove,</div>
        <div class="verse">Lest thou the price of my displeasure prove.'</div>
        <div class="verse">So spake this bold Brere with great disdain:</div>
        <div class="verse">Little him answered the Oak again,</div>
        <div class="verse">But yielded, with shame and grief adawed,</div>
        <div class="verse">That of a weed he was overcrawed.</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;It chanced after upon a day,</div>
        <div class="verse">The husbandman self to come that way,</div>
        <div class="verse">Of custom for to surview his ground,</div>
        <div class="verse">And his trees of state in compass round:</div>
        <div class="verse">Him when the spiteful Brere had espied,</div>
        <div class="verse">Causeless complained, and loudly cried</div>
        <div class="verse">Unto his lord, stirring up stern strife:</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;'O my liege lord! the god of my life,</div>
        <div class="verse">Pleaseth you ponder your suppliant's plaint,</div>
        <div class="verse">Caused of wrong and cruel constraint,</div>
        <div class="verse">Which I your poor vassal daily endure;</div>
        <div class="verse">And, but your goodness the same recure,</div>
        <div class="verse">Am like for desperate dool to die,</div>
        <div class="verse">Through felonous force of mine enemy.'</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;Greatly aghast with this piteous plea,</div>
        <div class="verse">Him rested the goodman on the lea,</div>
        <div class="verse">And bade the Brere in his plaint proceed.</div>
        <div class="verse">With painted words then gan this proud weed</div>
        <div class="verse">(As most usen ambitious folk)</div>
        <div class="verse">His coloured crime with craft to cloak.</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;'Ah, my sovereign! lord of creatures all,</div>
        <div class="verse">Thou placer of plants both humble and tall,</div>
        <div class="verse">Was not I planted of thine own hand,</div>
        <div class="verse">To be the primrose of all thy land;</div>
        <div class="verse">With flow'ring blossoms to furnish the prime,</div>
        <div class="verse">And scarlet berries in summer time?</div>
        <div class="verse">How falls it then that this faded Oak,</div>
        <div class="verse">Whose body is sere, whose branches broke,</div>
        <div class="verse">Whose naked arms stretch unto the fire,</div>
        <div class="verse">Unto such tyranny doth aspire;</div>
        <div class="verse">Hindering with his shade my lovely light,</div>
        <div class="verse">And robbing me of the sweet sun's sight?</div>
        <div class="verse">So beat his old boughs my tender side,</div>
        <div class="verse">That oft the blood springeth from wound&euml;s wide;</div>
        <div class="verse">Untimely my flowers forced to fall,</div>
        <div class="verse">That be the honour of your coronal:</div>
        <div class="verse">And oft he lets his canker-worms light</div>
        <div class="verse">Upon my branches, to work me more spite;</div>
        <div class="verse">And oft his hoary locks down doth cast,</div>
        <div class="verse">Wherewith my fresh flow'rets be defast:</div>
        <div class="verse">For this, and many more such outrage,</div>
        <div class="verse">Craving your goodlyhead to assuage</div>
        <div class="verse">The rancorous rigour of his might;</div>
        <div class="verse">Nought ask I, but only to hold my right;</div>
        <div class="verse">Submitting me to your good sufferance,</div>
        <div class="verse">And praying to be guarded from grievance.'</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;To this this Oak cast him to reply</div>
        <div class="verse">Well as he couth; but his enemy</div>
        <div class="verse">Had kindled such coals of displeasure,</div>
        <div class="verse">That the goodman nould stay his leisure,</div>
        <div class="verse">But home him hasted with furious heat,</div>
        <div class="verse">Increasing his wrath with many a threat:</div>
        <div class="verse">His harmful hatchet he hent in hand,</div>
        <div class="verse">(Alas! that it so ready should stand!)</div>
        <div class="verse">And to the field alone he speedeth,</div>
        <div class="verse">(Aye little help to harm there needeth!)</div>
        <div class="verse">Anger nould let him speak to the tree,</div>
        <div class="verse">Enaunter his rage might cooled be;</div>
        <div class="verse">But to the root bent his sturdy stroke,</div>
        <div class="verse">And made many wounds in the waste Oak.</div>
        <div class="verse">The axe's edge did oft turn again,</div>
        <div class="verse">As half unwilling to cut the grain;</div>
        <div class="verse">Seemed, the senseless iron did fear,</div>
        <div class="verse">Or to wrong holy eld did forbear;</div>
        <div class="verse">For it had been an ancient tree,</div>
        <div class="verse">Sacred with many a mystery,</div>
        <div class="verse">And often cross'd with the priests' crew,</div>
        <div class="verse">And often hallowed with holy-water dew:</div>
        <div class="verse">But sike fancies weren foolery,</div>
        <div class="verse">And broughten this Oak to this misery;</div>
        <div class="verse">For nought might they quitten him from decay,</div>
        <div class="verse">For fiercely the goodman at him did lay.</div>
        <div class="verse">The block oft groaned under the blow,</div>
        <div class="verse">And sighed to see his near overthrow.</div>
        <div class="verse">In fine, the steel had pierced his pith,</div>
        <div class="verse">Then down to the earth he fell forthwith.</div>
        <div class="verse">His wondrous weight made the ground to quake,</div>
        <div class="verse">Th' earth shrunk under him, and seemed to shake:&mdash;</div>
        <div class="verse">There lieth the Oak, pitied of none!</div>
        <div class="verse2">&quot;Now stands the Brere like a lord alone,</div>
        <div class="verse">Puffed up with pride and vain pleasance;</div>
        <div class="verse">But all this glee had no continuance:</div>
        <div class="verse">For eftsoons winter gan to approach;</div>
        <div class="verse">The blust'ring Boreas did encroach,</div>
        <div class="verse">And beat upon the solitary Brere;</div>
        <div class="verse">For now no succour was seen him near.</div>
        <div class="verse">Now gan he repent his pride too late;</div>
        <div class="verse">For, naked left and disconsolate,</div>
        <div class="verse">The biting frost nipt his stalk dead,</div>
        <div class="verse">The watry wet weighed down his head,</div>
        <div class="verse">And heaped snow burden'd him so sore,</div>
        <div class="verse">That now upright he can stand no more;</div>
        <div class="verse">And, being down, is trod in the durt</div>
        <div class="verse">Of cattle, and broused, and sorely hurt.</div>
        <div class="verse">Such was th' end of this ambitious Brere,</div>
        <div class="verse">For scorning eld&mdash;&quot;</div>
        <div class="verse">CUD. Now I pray thee, shepheard, tell it not forth:</div>
        <div class="verse">Here is a long tale, and little worth.</div>
        <div class="verse">So long have I listened to thy speech,</div>
        <div class="verse">That graffed to the ground is my breech;</div>
        <div class="verse">My heartblood is well nigh frorne I feel,</div>

    <p class="p2">In this &AElig;glogue two Shepheards' Boys, taking occasion of the season, begin to make purpose of love, and other pleasance
	which to springtime is most agreeable. The special meaning hereof is, to give certain marks and tokens, to know Cupid the poets' god of
	Love. But more particularly, I think, in the person of Thomalin, is meant some secret friend, who scorned Love and his knights so long,
	till at length himself was entangled, and unwares wounded with the dart of some beautiful regard, which is Cupid's arrow.</p>

        <div class="verse">For winter's wrath begins to quell,</div>

        <div class="verse">The swallow peeps out of her nest,</div>

        <div class="verse">Or hast thyself his slumber broke?</div>
        <div class="verse2">Or made privy to the same?</div>
        <div class="verse">THO. No; but happily I him spied,</div>
        <div class="verse">Where in a bush he did him hide,</div>
        <div class="verse2">With wings of purple and blue;</div>
        <div class="verse">And, were not that my sheep would stray,</div>

        <div class="verse">For sithens is but the third morrow</div>
        <div class="verse">That I chanc'd to fall asleep with sorrow,</div>
        <div class="verse2">And waked again with grief;</div>
        <div class="verse">The while thilk same unhappy ewe,</div>
        <div class="verse">Whose clouted leg her hurt doth shew,</div>
        <div class="verse2">Fell headlong into a dell,</div>
        <div class="verse">And there unjointed both her bones:</div>

        <div class="verse2">Now tell us what thou hast seen.</div>
        <div class="verse">THO. It was upon a holiday,</div>
        <div class="verse">When shepheards' grooms have leave to play,</div>
        <div class="verse2">I cast to go a shooting;</div>
        <div class="verse">Long wand'ring up and down the land,</div>
        <div class="verse">With bow and bolts in either hand,</div>
        <div class="verse2">For birds in bushes tooting,</div>
        <div class="verse">At length within the ivy tod,</div>
        <div class="verse">(There shrouded was the little god,)</div>
        <div class="verse2">I heard a busy bustling;</div>
        <div class="verse">I bent my bolt against the bush,</div>
        <div class="verse">List'ning if any thing did rush,</div>
        <div class="verse2">But then heard no more rustling.</div>
        <div class="verse">Then, peeping close into the thick,</div>
        <div class="verse">Might see the moving of some quick,</div>
        <div class="verse2">Whose shape appeared not;</div>
        <div class="verse">But were it faery, fiend, or snake,</div>
        <div class="verse">My courage yearn'd it to awake,</div>
        <div class="verse2">And manfully thereat shot:</div>
        <div class="verse">With that sprang forth a naked swain;</div>
        <div class="verse">With spotted wings like peacock's train,</div>
        <div class="verse2">And laughing lope to a tree;</div>
        <div class="verse">His gilden quiver at his back,</div>
        <div class="verse">And silver bow, which was but slack,</div>
        <div class="verse2">Which lightly he bent at me:</div>
        <div class="verse">That seeing, I levell'd again,</div>
        <div class="verse">And shot at him with might and main,</div>
        <div class="verse2">As thick as it had hailed.</div>
        <div class="verse">So long I shot, that all was spent;</div>
        <div class="verse">Then pumie stones I hast'ly hent,</div>
        <div class="verse2">And threw; but nought availed:</div>
        <div class="verse">He was so wimble and so wight,</div>
        <div class="verse">From bough to bough he leaped light,</div>
        <div class="verse2">And oft the pumies latched:</div>
        <div class="verse">Therewith afraid I ran away;</div>
        <div class="verse">But he, that erst seem'd but to play,</div>
        <div class="verse2">A shaft in earnest snatched,</div>
        <div class="verse">And hit me running in the heel:</div>
        <div class="verse">For then I little smart did feel,</div>
        <div class="verse2">But soon it sore increased;</div>
        <div class="verse">And now it rankleth more and more,</div>
        <div class="verse">And inwardly it fest'reth sore,</div>
        <div class="verse2">Ne wote I how to cease it.</div>
        <div class="verse">WIL. Thomalin, I pity thy plight,</div>
        <div class="verse">Perdie with Love thou didest fight;</div>
        <div class="verse2">I know him by a token:</div>
        <div class="verse">For once I heard my father say,</div>
        <div class="verse">How he him caught upon a day,</div>
        <div class="verse2">(Whereof he will be wroken,)</div>
        <div class="verse">Entangled in a fowling net,</div>
        <div class="verse">Which he for carrion crows had set</div>
        <div class="verse2">That in our pear-tree haunted:</div>
        <div class="verse">Then said, he was a winged lad,</div>
        <div class="verse">But bow and shafts as then none had,</div>
        <div class="verse2">Else had he sore been daunted.</div>
        <div class="verse">But see, the welkin thicks apace,</div>
        <div class="verse">And stooping Ph&oelig;bus steeps his face;</div>
        <div class="verse2">It's time to haste us homeward. </div>

    <p class="p2">This &AElig;glogue is purposely intended to the honour and praise of our most gracious sovereign, Queen Elizabeth.
	The speakers hereof be Hobbinol and Thenot, two shepheards: the which Hobbinol, being beforementioned greatly to have loved Colin,
	is here set forth more largely, complaining him of that boy's great misadventure in love; whereby his mind was alienated and withdrawn
	not only from him, who most loved him, but also from all former delights and studies, as well in pleasant piping, as cunning rhyming and
	singing, and other his laudable exercises. Whereby he taketh occasion, for proof of his more excellency and skill in poetry, to record a
	song, which the said Colin sometime made in honour of her Majesty, whom abruptly he termeth Elisa.</p>

		<div class="verse">With them it sits to care for their heir,</div>
		<div class="verse">Enaunter their heritage do impair:</div>
		<div class="verse">They must provide for means of maintenance,</div>
		<div class="verse">And to continue their wont countenance:</div>
		<div class="verse">But shepheard must walk another way,</div>
		<div class="verse">Sike worldly sovenance he must for-say.</div>
		<div class="verse">The son of his loins why should he regard</div>
		<div class="verse">To leave enriched with that he hath spar'd?</div>
		<div class="verse">Should not thilk God, that gave him that good,</div>
		<div class="verse">Eke cherish his child, if in his ways he stood?</div>
		<div class="verse">For if he mislive in lewdness and lust,</div>
		<div class="verse">Little boots all the wealth, and the trust,</div>
		<div class="verse">That his father left by inheritance;</div>
		<div class="verse">All will be soon wasted with misgovernance:</div>
		<div class="verse">But through this, and other their miscreance,</div>
		<div class="verse">They maken many a wrong chevisance,</div>
		<div class="verse">Heaping up waves of wealth and woe,</div>
		<div class="verse">The floods whereof shall them overflow.</div>
		<div class="verse">Sike men's folly I cannot compare</div>
		<div class="verse">Better than to the ape's foolish care,</div>
		<div class="verse">That is so enamoured of her young one,</div>
		<div class="verse">(And yet, God wot, such cause had she none,)</div>
		<div class="verse">That with her hard hold, and strait embracing,
    </div><div class="verse">She stoppeth the breath of her youngling.
    </div><div class="verse">So oftentimes, whenas good is meant,
    </div><div class="verse">Evil ensueth of wrong intent.
      </div><div class="verse2">The time was once, and may again retorn,
    </div><div class="verse">(For ought may happen, that hath been beforn,)
    </div><div class="verse">When shepheards had none inheritance,
    </div><div class="verse">Ne of land nor fee in sufferance,
    </div><div class="verse">But what might arise of the bare sheep,
    </div><div class="verse">(Were it more or less) which they did keep.
    </div><div class="verse">Well ywis was it with shepheards then:
    </div><div class="verse">Nought having, nought feared they to forego;
    </div><div class="verse">For Pan himself was their inheritance,
    </div><div class="verse">And little them served for their maintenance.
    </div><div class="verse">The shepheards' God so well them guided,
    </div><div class="verse">That of nought they were unprovided;
    </div><div class="verse">Butter enough, honey, milk, and whey,
    </div><div class="verse">And their flocks' fleeces them to array:
    </div><div class="verse">But tract of time, and long prosperity,
    </div><div class="verse">(That nurse of vice, this of insolency,)
    </div><div class="verse">Lulled the shepheards in such security,
    </div><div class="verse">That, not content with loyal obeisance,
    </div><div class="verse">Some gan to gape for greedy governance,
    </div><div class="verse">And match them self with mighty potentates,
    </div><div class="verse">Lovers of lordship, and troublers of states:
    </div><div class="verse">Then gan shepheards' swains to look aloft,
    </div><div class="verse">And leave to live hard, and learn to ligg soft:
    </div><div class="verse">Then, under colour of shepheards, somewhile
   </div><div class="verse">There crept in wolves, full of fraud and guile,
    </div><div class="verse">That often devoured their own sheep,
    </div><div class="verse">And often the shepheards that did them keep:
    </div><div class="verse">This was the first source of shepheards' sorrow,
    </div><div class="verse">That now nill be quit with bail nor borrow.
    </div><div class="verse">PAL. Three things to bear be very burdenous,
    </div><div class="verse">But the fourth to forbear is outrageous:
    </div><div class="verse">Women, that of love's longing once lust,
    </div><div class="verse">Hardly forbearen, but have it they must:
    </div><div class="verse">So when choler is inflamed with rage,
    </div><div class="verse">Wanting revenge, is hard to assuage:
    </div><div class="verse">And who can counsel a thirsty soul,
    </div><div class="verse">With patience to forbear the offer'd bowl?
    </div><div class="verse">But of all burdens, that a man can bear,
    </div><div class="verse">Most is, a fool's talk to bear and to hear.
    </div><div class="verse">I ween the giant has not such a weight,
    </div><div class="verse">That bears on his shoulders the heaven's height.
    </div><div class="verse">Thou findest fault where n'is to be found,
    </div><div class="verse">And buildest strong work upon a weak ground:
    </div><div class="verse">Thou railest on right withouten reason,
    </div><div class="verse">And blamest them much for small encheason.
    </div><div class="verse">How shoulden shepheards live, if not so?
    </div><div class="verse">What? should they pinen in pain and woe?
    </div><div class="verse">Nay, say I thereto, by my dear borrow,
    </div><div class="verse">If I may rest, I nill live in sorrow.
      </div><div class="verse2">Sorrow ne need be hastened on,
    </div><div class="verse">For he will come, without calling, anon,
    </div><div class="verse">While times enduren of tranquillity,
    </div><div class="verse">Usen we freely our felicity;
    </div><div class="verse">For, when approachen the stormy stowres,
    </div><div class="verse">We must with our shoulders bear off the sharp showers;
    </div><div class="verse">And, sooth to sayn, nought seemeth sike strife,
    </div><div class="verse">That shepheards so witen each other's life,
    </div><div class="verse">And layen their faults the worlds beforn,
    </div><div class="verse">The while their foes do each of them scorn.
    </div><div class="verse">Let none mislike of that may not be mended;
    </div><div class="verse">So contest soon by concord might be ended.
    </div><div class="verse">PIERS. Shepheard, I list no accordance make
    </div><div class="verse">With shepheard, that does the right way forsake;
    </div><div class="verse">And of the twain, if choice were to me,
    </div><div class="verse">Had lever my foe than my friend he be;
    </div><div class="verse">For what concord have light and dark sam?
   </div><div class="verse">Or what peace has the lion with the lamb?
    </div><div class="verse">Such faitours, when their false hearts be hid,

    </div><div class="verse">PAL. Now, Piers, of fellowship, tell us that saying;
    </div><div class="verse">For the lad can keep both our flocks from straying.
    </div><div class="verse">PIERS. Thilk same Kid (as I can well devise)
    </div><div class="verse">Was too very foolish and unwise;
    </div><div class="verse">For on a time, in summer season,
    </div><div class="verse">The Goat her dam, that had good reason,
    </div><div class="verse">Yode forth abroad unto the green wood,
    </div><div class="verse">To brouze, or play, or what she thought good:
    </div><div class="verse">But, for she had a motherly care
    </div><div class="verse">Of her young son, and wit to beware,
    </div><div class="verse">She set her youngling before her knee,
    </div><div class="verse">That was both fresh and lovely to see,
    </div><div class="verse">And full of favour as kid might be.
    </div><div class="verse">His velvet head began to shoot out,
    </div><div class="verse">And his wreathed horns gan newly sprout;
    </div><div class="verse">The blossoms of lust to bud did begin,
    </div><div class="verse">And spring forth rankly under his chin.
    </div><div class="verse">"My son," (quoth she, and with that gan weep;
    </div><div class="verse">For careful thoughts in her heart did creep;)
    </div><div class="verse">"God bless thee, poor orphan! as he might me,
    </div><div class="verse">And send thee joy of thy jollity.
    </div><div class="verse">Thy father," (that word she spake with pain,
    </div><div class="verse">For a sigh had nigh rent her heart in twain,)
    </div><div class="verse">"Thy father, had he lived this day,
    </div><div class="verse">To see the branch of his body display,
    </div><div class="verse">How would he have joyed at this sweet sight?
    </div><div class="verse">But ah! false Fortune such joy did him spite,
    </div><div class="verse">And cut off his days with untimely woe,
    </div><div class="verse">Betraying him into the trains of his foe.
    </div><div class="verse">Now I, a wailful widow behight,
    </div><div class="verse">Of my old age have this one delight,
    </div><div class="verse">To see thee succeed in thy father's stead,
    </div><div class="verse">And flourish in flowers of lustihead;
    </div><div class="verse">For even so thy father his head upheld,
    </div><div class="verse">And so his haughty horns did he weld."
      </div><div class="verse2">Then marking him with melting eyes,
    </div><div class="verse">A thrilling throb from her heart did arise,
    </div><div class="verse">And interrupted all her other speech
    </div><div class="verse">With some old sorrow that made a new breach;
    </div><div class="verse">Seemed she saw in her youngling's face
    </div><div class="verse">The old lineaments of his father's grace.
    </div><div class="verse">At last her sullen silence she broke,
    </div><div class="verse">And gan his new-budded beard to stroke.
    </div><div class="verse">"Kiddie," (quoth she,) "thou kenst the great care
    </div><div class="verse">I have of thy health and thy welfare,
    </div><div class="verse">Which many wild beasts liggen in wait
    </div><div class="verse">For to entrap in thy tender state:
    </div><div class="verse">But most the Fox, master of collusion;
    </div><div class="verse">For he has vowed thy last confusion.
    </div><div class="verse">Forthy, my Kiddie, be rul'd by me,
    </div><div class="verse">And never give trust to his treachery;
    </div><div class="verse">And, if he chance come when I am abroad,
    </div><div class="verse">Sperr the gate fast, for fear of fraud;
    </div><div class="verse">Ne for all his worst, nor for his best,
    </div><div class="verse">Open the door at his request."
    </div><div class="verse2">So schooled the Goat her wanton son,
    </div><div class="verse">That answer'd his mother, all should be done.
    </div><div class="verse">Then went the pensive dam out of door,
    </div><div class="verse">And chanc'd to stumble at the threshold floor;
    </div><div class="verse">Her stumbling step somewhat her amazed,
    </div><div class="verse">(For such, as signs of ill luck, be dispraised;)
    </div><div class="verse">Yet forth she yode, thereat half aghast;
    </div><div class="verse">And Kiddie the door sperred after her fast.
    </div><div class="verse">It was not long, after she was gone,
    </div><div class="verse">But the false Fox came to the door anone;
   </div><div class="verse"> Not as a fox, for then he had be kend,
    </div><div class="verse">But all as a poor pedlar he did wend,
    </div><div class="verse">Bearing a truss of trifles at his back,
    </div><div class="verse">As bells, and babes, and glasses, in his pack:
    </div><div class="verse">A biggen he had got about his brain,
    </div><div class="verse">For in his headpiece he felt a sore pain:
    </div><div class="verse">His hinder heel was wrapt in a clout,
    </div><div class="verse">For with great cold he had got the gout:
    </div><div class="verse">There at the door he cast me down his pack,
    </div><div class="verse">And laid him down, and groaned, "Alack! alack!
    </div><div class="verse">Ah! dear Lord! and sweet Saint Charity!
    </div><div class="verse">That some good body would once pity me!"
      </div><div class="verse2">Well heard Kiddie all this sore constraint,
    </div><div class="verse">And long'd to know the cause of his complaint;
    </div><div class="verse">Then, creeping close behind the wicket's clink,
   </div><div class="verse">Privily he peeped out through a chink,
    </div><div class="verse">Yet not so privily but the Fox him spied;
    </div><div class="verse">For deceitful meaning is double-eyed.
      </div><div class="verse2">"Ah! good young master," (then gan he cry,)
    </div><div class="verse">"Jesus bless that sweet face I espy,
    </div><div class="verse">And keep your corpse from the careful stounds
    </div><div class="verse">That in my carrion carcase abounds."
      </div><div class="verse2">The Kid, pitying his heaviness,
    </div><div class="verse">Asked the cause of his great distress,
    </div><div class="verse">And also who, and whence that he were.
      </div><div class="verse2">Then he, that had well yconn'd his lere,
    </div><div class="verse">Thus medled his talk with many a tear:
    </div><div class="verse">"Sick, sick, alas! and little lack of dead,
    </div><div class="verse">But I be relieved by your beastlyhead.
    </div><div class="verse">I am a poor sheep, albe my colour dun,
    </div><div class="verse">For with long travel I am brent in the sun;
    </div><div class="verse">And if that, my grandsire me said, be true,
    </div><div class="verse">Sicker, I am very sib to you;
    </div><div class="verse">So be your goodlihead do not disdain
    </div><div class="verse">The base kindred of so simple swain.
    </div><div class="verse">Of mercy and favour then I you pray,
    </div><div class="verse">With your aid to forestall my near decay."
      </div><div class="verse2">Then out of his pack a glass he took,
    </div><div class="verse">Wherein while Kiddie unwares did look,
    </div><div class="verse">He was so enamoured with the newell,
    </div><div class="verse">That nought he deemed dear for the jewel:
    </div><div class="verse">Then opened he the door, and in came
    </div><div class="verse">The false Fox, as he were stark lame:
    </div><div class="verse">His tail he clapt betwixt his legs twain,
    </div><div class="verse">Lest he should be descried by his train.
      </div><div class="verse2">Being within, the Kid made him good glee,
    </div><div class="verse">All for the love of the glass he did see.
    </div><div class="verse">After his cheer, the pedlar gan chat,
    </div><div class="verse">And tell many leasings of this and that,
    </div><div class="verse">And how he could shew many a fine knack;
    </div><div class="verse">Then shewed his ware and opened his pack,
    </div><div class="verse">All save a bell, which he left behind
    </div><div class="verse">In the basket for the Kid to find;
    </div><div class="verse">Which when the Kid stooped down to catch,
    </div><div class="verse">He popt him in, and his basket did latch;
    </div><div class="verse">Ne stayed he once the door to make fast,
    </div><div class="verse">But ran away with him in all hast.
      </div><div class="verse2">Home when the doubtful dame had her hied,
    </div><div class="verse">She might see the door stand open wide;
    </div><div class="verse">All aghast, loudly she gan to call
    </div><div class="verse">Her Kid; but he nould answer at all:
    </div><div class="verse">Then on the floor she saw the merchandice
    </div><div class="verse">Of which her son had set too dear a price.
    </div><div class="verse">What help! her Kid she knew well was gone:
    </div><div class="verse">She weeped, and wailed, and made great moan.
    </div><div class="verse">Such end had the Kid, for he nould warned be
    </div><div class="verse">Of craft, coloured with simplicity;
    </div><div class="verse">And such end, perdie, does all them remain,
    </div><div class="verse">That of such falsers' friendship be fain.
    </div><div class="verse">PAL. Truly, Piers, thou art beside thy wit,
    </div><div class="verse">Furthest fro the mark, weening it to hit.
    </div><div class="verse">Now, I pray thee, let me thy tale borrow

    </div><div class="verse">As soon may shepheard climb to sky
      </div><div class="verse2">That leads in lowly dales,
    </div><div class="verse">As goatherd proud, that, sitting high,
      </div><div class="verse2">Upon the mountain sails.
    </div><div class="verse">My seely sheep like well below,
      </div><div class="verse2">They need not melampode,
    </div><div class="verse">For they be hale enough, I trow,

    </div><div class="verse">Or like not of the frowy feed,
      </div><div class="verse2">Or with the weeds be glutted.
    </div><div class="verse">The hills, where dwelled holy saints,
      </div><div class="verse2">I reverence and adore,
    </div><div class="verse">Not for themself, but for the saints
      </div><div class="verse2">Which have been dead of yore.
    </div><div class="verse">And now they be to heaven forewent,

    </div><div class="verse">Their sample only to us lent,
      </div><div class="verse2">That als we might do so.
    </div><div class="verse">Shepheards they weren of the best,
      </div><div class="verse2">And lived in lowly leas;
    </div><div class="verse">And, sith they souls be now at rest,
      </div><div class="verse2">Why do we them disease?
    </div><div class="verse">Such one he was (as I have heard
      </div><div class="verse2">Old Algrind often sayn)
    </div><div class="verse">That whilome was the first shepheard,
      </div><div class="verse2">And lived with little gain:
    </div><div class="verse">And meek he was, as meek might be,
      </div><div class="verse2">Simple as simple sheep;
    </div><div class="verse">Humble, and like in each degree
      </div><div class="verse2">The flock which he did keep.
    </div><div class="verse">Often he used of his keep
      </div><div class="verse2">A sacrifice to bring,
    </div><div class="verse">Now with a kid, now with a sheep,
      </div><div class="verse2">The altars hallowing.
    </div><div class="verse">So louted he unto his Lord,
      </div><div class="verse2">Such favour couth he find,
	</div><div class="verse">That never sithens was abhorr'd
     </div><div class="verse2">The simple shepheards' kind.
    </div><div class="verse">And such, I ween, the brethren were
      </div><div class="verse2">That came from Canaän,
    </div><div class="verse">The brethren Twelve, that kept yfere
      </div><div class="verse2">The flocks of mighty Pan.
    </div><div class="verse">But nothing such thilk shepheard was
      </div><div class="verse2">Whom Ida hill did bear,
    </div><div class="verse">That left his flock to fetch a lass,
      </div><div class="verse2">Whose love he bought too dear.
    </div><div class="verse">For he was proud, that ill was paid,
      </div><div class="verse2">(No such must shepheards be!)
    </div><div class="verse">And with lewd lust was overlaid;
      </div><div class="verse2">Two things doen ill agree.
    </div><div class="verse">But shepheard must be meek and mild,
      </div><div class="verse2">Well-eyed, as Argus was,
    </div><div class="verse">With fleshly follies undefiled,
      </div><div class="verse2">And stout as steed of brass.
    </div><div class="verse">Such one (said Algrind) Moses was,
      </div><div class="verse2">That saw his Maker's face,
    </div><div class="verse">His face, more clear then crystal glass,
      </div><div class="verse2">And spake to him in place.
    </div><div class="verse">This had a brother, (his name I knew,)
      </div><div class="verse2">The first of all his cote,
    </div><div class="verse">A shepheard true, yet not so true
      </div><div class="verse2">As he that erst I hote.
    </div><div class="verse">Whilome all these were low and lief,
      </div><div class="verse2">And loved their flocks to feed;
    </div><div class="verse">They never stroven to be chief,
      </div><div class="verse2">And simple was their weed:
    </div><div class="verse">But now (thanked be God therefore!)
      </div><div class="verse2">The world is well amend,
    </div><div class="verse">Their weeds be not so nighly wore;
      </div><div class="verse2">Such simplesse might them shend!
    </div><div class="verse">They be yclad in purple and pall,
      </div><div class="verse2">So hath their God them blist;
    </div><div class="verse">They reign and rulen over all,
      </div><div class="verse2">And lord it as they list;
    </div><div class="verse">Ygirt with belts of glittering gold,
      </div><div class="verse2">(Might they good shepheards been!)
    </div><div class="verse">Their Pan their sheep to them has sold,
      </div><div class="verse2">I say as some have seen.
    </div><div class="verse">For Palinode (if thou him ken)
      </div><div class="verse2">Yode late on pilgrimage
	</div><div class="verse">To Rome, (if such be Rome,) and then
      </div><div class="verse2">He saw thilk misusage;
    </div><div class="verse">For shepheards (said he) there doen lead,
      </div><div class="verse2">As lords done other where;
    </div><div class="verse">Their sheep have crusts, and they the bread;
      </div><div class="verse2">The chips, and they the cheer:
    </div><div class="verse">They have the fleece, and eke the flesh,
      </div><div class="verse2">(O seely sheep the while!)
    </div><div class="verse">The corn is theirs, let others thresh,
      </div><div class="verse2">Their hands they may not file.
    </div><div class="verse">They have great store and thrifty stocks,
      </div><div class="verse2">Great friends and feeble foes;
    </div><div class="verse">What need them caren for their flocks,
      </div><div class="verse2">Their boys can look to those.
    </div><div class="verse">These wisards welter in wealth's waves,
      </div><div class="verse2">Pamper'd in pleasures deep;
    </div><div class="verse">They have fat kerns, and leany knaves,
      </div><div class="verse2">Their fasting flocks to keep.
    </div><div class="verse">Sike mister men be all misgone,
      </div><div class="verse2">They heapen hills of wrath;
    </div><div class="verse">Such surly shepheards have we none,
      </div><div class="verse2">They keepen all the path.
    </div><div class="verse">MOR. Here is a great deal of good matter
      </div><div class="verse2">Lost for lack of telling;
    </div><div class="verse">Now sicker I see thou dost but clatter,
      </div><div class="verse2">Harm may come of melling.
    </div><div class="verse">Thou meddlest more than shall have thank,
      </div><div class="verse2">To witen shepheards' wealth;
    </div><div class="verse">When folk be fat, and riches rank,
      </div><div class="verse2">It is a sign of health.
    </div><div class="verse">But say me, what is Algrind, he
      </div><div class="verse2">That is so oft benempt?
    </div><div class="verse">THOM. He is a shepheard great in gree,

of that in Theocritus: whereto also Virgil fashioned his third and
seventh Æglogue. They chose for umpire of their strife, Cuddy, a
neat-herd's boy; who, having ended their cause, reciteth also himself a
proper song, whereof Colin he saith was author.</p>

      <div class="verse2">Wherefore with mine thou dare thy music match?</div>
    <div class="verse">Or be thy bagpipes run far out of frame?</div>
     <div class="verse2">Or hath the cramp thy joints benumb'd with ache?</div>
    <div class="verse">PER. Ah! Willie, when the heart is ill assay'd,</div>
    <div class="verse">How can bagpipe or joints be well apaid?</div>
    <div class="verse">WIL. What the foul evil hath thee so bestad?</div>
      <div class="verse2">Whilome thou was peregall to the best,</div>
    <div class="verse">And wont to make the jolly shepheards glad,</div>
      <div class="verse2">With piping and dancing didst pass the rest.</div>
    <div class="verse">PER. Ah! Willie, now I have learn'd a new dance;</div>
    <div class="verse">My old music marr'd by a new mischance.</div>
    <div class="verse">WIL. Mischief might to that mischance befall,</div>

      <div class="verse2">Or lovest thou, or be thy younglings miswent?</div>
    <div class="verse">PER. Love hath misled both my younglings and me;</div>
    <div class="verse">I pine for pain, and they my pain to see.</div>
    <div class="verse">WIL. Perdie, and wellaway! ill may they thrive;</div>
      <div class="verse2">Never knew I lover's sheep in good plight:</div>

    <div class="verse">PER. That shall I do, though mochell worse I fared:</div>
    <div class="verse">Never shall be said that Perigot was dared.</div>
    <div class="verse">WIL. Then lo, Perigot, the pledge which I plight,</div>
      <div class="verse2">A mazer ywrought of the maple warre,</div>
    <div class="verse">Wherein is enchased many a fair sight</div>
      <div class="verse2">Of bears and tigers, that maken fierce war;</div>
	<div class="verse">And over them spread a goodly wild vine,
    </div><div class="verse">Entrailed with a wanton ivy twine.
    </div><div class="verse">Thereby is a lamb in the wolvës jaws;

    </div><div class="verse">Tell me, such a cup hast thou ever seen?

    </div><div class="verse">PER. Thereto will I pawn yonder spotted lamb;
      </div><div class="verse2">Of all my flock there n'is such another,
    </div><div class="verse">For I brought him up without the dam;
      </div><div class="verse2">But Colin Clout reft me of his brother,

    </div><div class="verse">WIL. But, for the sunbeam so sore doth us beat,
    </div><div class="verse">Were not better to shun the scorching heat?
    </div><div class="verse">PER. Well agreed, Willie; then set thee down, swain;
      </div><div class="verse2">Such a song never heardest thou but Colin sing.
    </div><div class="verse">CUD. 'Gin, when ye list, ye jolly shepheards twain;
      </div><div class="verse2">Such a judge, as Cuddie, were for a king.

    </div><div class="verse">PER. The while my flock did feed thereby;
    </div><div class="verse">WIL. The while the shepheard self did spill;
    </div><div class="verse">PER. I saw the bouncing Bellibone,
	</div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, Bonnibell!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. Tripping over the dale alone;
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   She can trip it very well.

    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, gray is greet!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. And in a kirtle of green saye,

    </div><div class="verse">PER. A chapelet on her head she wore,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, chapelet!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. Of sweet violets therein was store,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   She sweeter than the violet.
    </div><div class="verse">PER. My sheep did leave their wonted food,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, seely sheep!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. And gaz'd on her as they were wood,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Wood as he that did them keep.
    </div><div class="verse">PER. As the bonilass passed by,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, bonilass!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. She rov'd at me with glancing eye,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   As clear as the crystal glass:

    </div><div class="verse">PER. Glanceth from Ph&oelig;bus' face forthright,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   So love into thy heart did stream:

    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Such play is a piteous plight.
    </div><div class="verse">PER. The glance into my heart did glide,

	</div><div class="verse">PER. Therewith my soul was sharply gryde,

    </div><div class="verse">PER. I left the head in my heart-root,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   It was a desperate shot.

    </div><div class="verse">PER. Ne can I find salve for my sore,

    </div><div class="verse">PER. Yet should thilk lass not from my thought,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   So you may buy gold too dear.
    </div><div class="verse">PER. But whether in painful love I pine,

    </div><div class="verse">PER. Or thrive in wealth, she shall be mine,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   But if thou can her obtain.
    </div><div class="verse">PER. And if for graceless grief I die,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, graceless grief!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. Witness she slew me with her eye,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Let thy folly be the prief.
    </div><div class="verse">PER. And you, that saw it, simple sheep,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, the fair flock!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. For prief thereof, my death shall weep,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   And moan with many a mock.
    </div><div class="verse">PER. So learn'd I love on a holy eve,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Hey, ho, holy-day!
    </div><div class="verse">PER. That ever since my heart did grieve,
    </div><div class="verse">WIL.   Now endeth our roundelay."
    </div><div class="verse">CUD. Sicker, such a roundel never heard I none;
	</div><div class="verse">Little lacketh Perigot of the best,
    </div><div class="verse">And Willie is not greatly overgone,
      </div><div class="verse2">So weren his under-songs well addrest.
    </div><div class="verse">WIL. Herdgroom, I fear me thou have a squint eye;
    </div><div class="verse">Arede uprightly, who has the victory.
    </div><div class="verse">CUD. Faith of my soul, I deem each have gained;
      </div><div class="verse2">Forthy let the lamb be Willie his own;
    </div><div class="verse">And for Perigot, so well hath him pained,
      </div><div class="verse2">To him be the wroughten mazer alone.

    </div><div class="verse">Ne can Willie wite the witeless herdgroom.
    </div><div class="verse">WIL. Never dempt more right of beauty, I ween,
    </div><div class="verse">The shepheard of Ida that judged Beauty's queen.

    </div><div class="verse">They boast they have the devil at command,
    </div><div class="verse">But ask them therefore what they have pawn'd:
    </div><div class="verse">Marry! that great Pan bought with dear borrow,
	</div><div class="verse">To quit it from the black bower of sorrow.
    </div><div class="verse">But they have sold thilk same long ago,
    </div><div class="verse">For they woulden draw with them many moe.
    </div><div class="verse">But let them gang alone a God's name;
    </div><div class="verse">As they have brewed, so let them bear blame.
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Diggon, I pray thee speak not so dirk;
    </div><div class="verse">Such mister saying me seemeth to mirk.
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. Then, plainly to speak of shepheards' most what,
    </div><div class="verse">Bad is the best; (this English is flat)
    </div><div class="verse">Their ill haviour gars men missay
    </div><div class="verse">Both of their doctrine, and their fay.
    </div><div class="verse">They sayn the world is much war than it wont,
    </div><div class="verse">All for her shepheards be beastly and blont.
    </div><div class="verse">Other sayn, but how truly I n'ote,
    </div><div class="verse">All for they holden shame of their cote:
    </div><div class="verse">Some stick not to say, (hot coal on their tongue!)
    </div><div class="verse">That such mischief graseth them among,
    </div><div class="verse">All for they casten too much of world's care,
    </div><div class="verse">To deck their dame, and enrich their heir;
    </div><div class="verse">For such encheason, if you go nigh,
    </div><div class="verse">Few chimneys reeking you shall espy.
    </div><div class="verse">The fat ox, that wont lig in the stall,
    </div><div class="verse">Is now fast stalled in their crumenall.
    </div><div class="verse">Thus chatten the people in their steads,
    </div><div class="verse">Alike as a monster of many heads:
    </div><div class="verse">But they, that shooten nearest the prick,
    </div><div class="verse">Sayn, other the fat from their beards doen lick:
	</div><div class="verse">For big bulls of Bashan brace them about,
    </div><div class="verse">That with their horns butten the more stout;
    </div><div class="verse">But the lean souls treaden under foot,
    </div><div class="verse">And to seek redress might little boot;
    </div><div class="verse">For liker be they to pluck away more,
    </div><div class="verse">Than ought of the gotten good to restore:
    </div><div class="verse">For they be like foul quagmires overgrass'd,
    </div><div class="verse">That, if thy galage once sticketh fast,
    </div><div class="verse">The more to wind it out thou dost swink,
   </div><div class="verse">Thou must aye deeper and deeper sink.
    </div><div class="verse">Yet better leave off with a little loss,
    </div><div class="verse">Than by much wrestling to lose the gross.
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Now, Diggon, I see thou speakest too plain;
    </div><div class="verse">Better it were a little to feign,
    </div><div class="verse">And cleanly cover that cannot be cured;
    </div><div class="verse">Such ill, as is forced, must needs be endured.
    </div><div class="verse">But of such pastors how do the flocks creep?
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. Such as the shepheards, such be their sheep,
    </div><div class="verse">For they nill listen to the shepheard's voice;
    </div><div class="verse">But if he call them, at their good choice
    </div><div class="verse">They wander at will and stay at pleasure,
    </div><div class="verse">And to their folds yede at their own leisure.
    </div><div class="verse">But they had be better come at their call;
    </div><div class="verse">For many have unto mischief fall,
    </div><div class="verse">And been of ravenous wolves yrent,
    </div><div class="verse">All for they nould be buxom and bent.
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Fie on thee, Diggon, and all thy foul leasing;
    </div><div class="verse">Well is known that, sith the Saxon king,<a id="fnanchor15" name="fnanchor15">&nbsp;</a><span class="fnanchor"><a href="#footnote15">15</a></span>
    </div><div class="verse">Never was wolf seen, many nor some,
    </div><div class="verse">Nor in all Kent, nor in Christendom;
    </div><div class="verse">But the fewer wolves (the sooth to sayn)
    </div><div class="verse">The more be the foxes that here remain.
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. Yes, but they gang in more secret wise,
	</div><div class="verse">And with sheeps' clothing doen them disguise.
    </div><div class="verse">They walk not widely as they were wont,
    </div><div class="verse">For fear of rangers and the great hunt,
    </div><div class="verse">But privily prowling to and fro,
    </div><div class="verse">Enaunter they might be inly know.
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Or privy or pert if any bin,
    </div><div class="verse">We have great bandogs will tear their skin.
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. Indeed thy Ball is a bold big cur,
    </div><div class="verse">And could make a jolly hole in their fur:
   </div><div class="verse">But not good dogs them needeth to chase,
    </div><div class="verse">But heedy shepheards to discern their face;
    </div><div class="verse">For all their craft is in their countenance,
    </div><div class="verse">They be so grave and full of maintenance.
    </div><div class="verse">But shall I tell thee what myself know
    </div><div class="verse">Chanced to Roffin not long ago?
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Say it out, Diggon, whatever it hight,
    </div><div class="verse">For not but well might him betight:
    </div><div class="verse">He is so meek, wise, and merciable,
    </div><div class="verse">And with his word his work is convenable.
    </div><div class="verse">Colin Clout, I ween, be his self boy,
    </div><div class="verse">(Ah, for Colin! he whilome my joy:)
	</div><div class="verse">Shepheards such, God might us many send,
    </div><div class="verse">That doen so carefully their flocks tend.
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. Thilk same shepheard might I well mark,
    </div><div class="verse">He has a dog to bite or to bark;
    </div><div class="verse">Never had shepheard so keen a cur,
    </div><div class="verse">That waketh and if but a leaf stur.
    </div><div class="verse">Whilome there wonned a wicked wolf,
    </div><div class="verse">That with many a lamb had gutted his gulf,
    </div><div class="verse">And ever at night wont to repair
    </div><div class="verse">Unto the flock, when the welkin shone fair,
    </div><div class="verse">Yclad in clothing of silly sheep,
    </div><div class="verse">When the good old man used to sleep;
    </div><div class="verse">Then at midnight he would bark and bawl,
    </div><div class="verse">(For he had eft learned a currës call,)
    </div><div class="verse">As if a wolf were among the sheep:
    </div><div class="verse">With that the shepheard would break his sleep,
    </div><div class="verse">And send out Lowder (for so his dog hote)
    </div><div class="verse">To range the fields with wide open throat.
    </div><div class="verse">Then, when as Lowder was far away,
    </div><div class="verse">This wolvish sheep would catchen his prey,
    </div><div class="verse">A lamb, or a kid, or a weanel wast;
    </div><div class="verse">With that to the wood would he speed him fast.
    </div><div class="verse">Long time he used this slippery prank,
    </div><div class="verse">Ere Roffy could for his labour him thank.
    </div><div class="verse">At end, the shepheard his practice spied,
    </div><div class="verse">(For Roffy is wise, and as Argus eyed,)
    </div><div class="verse">And, when at even he came to the flock,
    </div><div class="verse">Fast in their folds he did them lock,
    </div><div class="verse">And took out the wolf in his counterfeit coat,
    </div><div class="verse">And let out the sheep's blood at his throat.
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Marry, Diggon, what should him affray
    </div><div class="verse">To take his own where ever it lay?
    </div><div class="verse">For, had his weasand been a little widder,
	 </div><div class="verse">He would have devoured both hidder and shidder.
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. Mischief light on him, and God's great curse,
    </div><div class="verse">Too good for him had been a great deal worse;
    </div><div class="verse">For it was a perilous beast above all,
    </div><div class="verse">And eke had he cond the shepheard's call,
    </div><div class="verse">And oft in the night came to the sheep-cote,
   </div><div class="verse">And called Lowder, with a hollow throat,
    </div><div class="verse">As if the old man self had been:
    </div><div class="verse">The dog his master's voice did it ween,
    </div><div class="verse">Yet half in doubt he opened the door,
    </div><div class="verse">And ran out as he was wont of yore.
    </div><div class="verse">No sooner was out, but, swifter than thought,
    </div><div class="verse">Fast by the hide the wolf Lowder caught;
    </div><div class="verse">And, had not Roffy run to the steven,
    </div><div class="verse">Lowder had been slain thilk same even.
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. God shield, man, he should so ill have thrive,
    </div><div class="verse">All for he did his devoir belive.
    </div><div class="verse">If such be wolves, as thou hast told,
    </div><div class="verse">How might we, Diggon, them behold?
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. How, but, with heed and watchfulness,
    </div><div class="verse">Forstallen them of their wiliness:
    </div><div class="verse">Forthy with shepheard sits not play,
    </div><div class="verse">Or sleep, as some doen, all the long day;
    </div><div class="verse">But ever liggen in watch and ward,
    </div><div class="verse">From sudden force their flocks for to guard.
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Ah! Diggon, thilk same rule were too strait,
    </div><div class="verse">All the cold season to watch and wait:
    </div><div class="verse">We be of flesh, men as other be,
    </div><div class="verse">Why should we be bound to such misery?
    </div><div class="verse">Whatever thing lacketh changeable rest,
    </div><div class="verse">Must needs decay, when it is at best.
    </div><div class="verse">DIG. Ah! but, Hobbinol, all this long tale
    </div><div class="verse">Nought easeth the care that doth me forhaile;
	</div><div class="verse">What shall I do? what way shall I wend,
    </div><div class="verse">My piteous plight and loss to amend?
    </div><div class="verse">Ah! good Hobbinol, might I thee pray
    </div><div class="verse">Of aid or counsel in my decay?
    </div><div class="verse">HOB. Now by my soul, Diggon, I lament
    </div><div class="verse">The hapless mischief that has thee hent;
    </div><div class="verse">Natheless thou seest my lowly sail,
    </div><div class="verse">That froward Fortune doth ever availe:
    </div><div class="verse">But, were Hobbinol as God might please,

	<p class="p2">In Cuddie is set out the perfect pattern of a Poet, which, finding no
maintenance of his state and studies, complaineth of the contempt of
Poetry, and the causes thereof: specially having been in all ages, and
even amongst the most barbarous, always of singular account and honour,
and being indeed so worthy and commendable an art; or rather no art, but
a divine gift and heavenly instinct not to be gotten by labour and
learning, but adorned with both; and poured into the wit by a certain
Enthousiasmos and celestial inspiration, as the Author hereof elsewhere
at large discourseth in his book called <i>The English Poet</i>, which book
being lately come to my hands, I mind also by God's grace, upon further
advisement, to publish.</p>

blood, whom he calleth Dido. The personage is secret, and to me
altogether unknown, albeit of himself I often required the same. This
Æglogue is made in imitation of Marot his song, which he made upon the
death of Loyes the French Queen; but far passing his reach, and in mine
opinion all other the Æglogues of this Book.</p>
